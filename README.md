## Hello,
in this repository I learned how to use the Unity and Cmock framework, and the makefile syntax.
* http://www.throwtheswitch.org/unity

I got acquainted with the syntax of makefiles and thanks to that **_I built my own build system_**
* In my opinion, the created building system is very easy and convenient

In this example i used STM32CubeMX to generate project template for STM32F103
* Of course, it is not necessary to use STM32CubeMX **_the build system for unit tests is independent._** STM32CubeMX was used only to create template project for microcontroller.

## Created build system which using non recursive makefile is fully independent
* Evry one tested file may be compilated totally independent! :) 
	* It may be benefits

To download this repository tap in your command line:
* git clone --recursive https://github.com/trteodor/UnitTest_InEmbedded_Ex_OnSTM32F103RB_Unity_non-recmake

To compile this project i used:
* GNU Make 3.81
* ruby 2.7.4p191
* gcovr 5.0
* gcc 6.3.0
	* These programs obviously had to be in the ("PATH") path of environment variables
		* It means that it was possible to use this programs directly from the console
		
The build system I have prepared may need to be modified. As I mentioned, it was prepared solely for educational purposes

## Call "make" in the project localisation to show this information:

	Call: make help    -show this information
	How Use it:
	1. call: make all    -To compile output files for Microcontroller
	Its default target generated by CubeMX so was Decided to dont modify it
	------------------------------------
	2. Call: make test-ra       -To start compilation or fully recompilation all unit-test
	3. Call: make test-s        -Only to rebuild source files and start unit tests
	4. Call: make coverage      -To refresh coverage report
	------------------------------------
	5. call: make clean-test    -To delete all test result
	6. call: make clean-docs    -Remove Docs Folder (currently contain only unit-tests coverage report)
	6. call: make clean         -Remove build Folder (Carefully)
