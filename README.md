* Hello, in this reposirory i'am learning how use Unity and Cmock framework for unit test in embedded systems:
* http://www.throwtheswitch.org/unity
* 
* I also got acquainted with the syntax of makefiles and thanks to that I built my own build system
* In my opinion, the created building system is very easy and convenient
* 
To download this repository tap in your command line:
* git clone --recursive https://github.com/trteodor/UnitTest_InEmbedded_Ex_OnSTM32F103RB

To compile this project i used:
* GNU Make 3.81
* ruby 2.7.4p191
* gcovr 5.0
* gcc 6.3.0


* These programs obviously had to be in the ("PATH") path of environment variables
* It means that it was possible to use this programs directly from the console


Call "make" in the project localisation to show this information:

*help:
	@echo     Call: make help \ \ \ -show this information
	@echo	  How Use it:
	@echo	  1. call: make all  \ \ \ -To compile output files for Microcontroller
	@echo	  Its default target generated by CubeMX so was Decided to dont modify it
		@echo	  ------------------------------------
	@echo	  2. Call: make test-ra \ \ \ \ \ \ -To start compilation or fully recompilation all unit-test
	@echo	  3. Call: make test-s \ \ \  \ \ \ -Only to rebuild source files and start unit tests
	@echo	  4. Call: make coverage \ \ \ \ \ -To refresh coverage report
	@echo	  ------------------------------------
	@echo	  5. call: make clean-test \ \ \ -To delete all test result
	@echo	  6. call: make clean-docs  \ \ \ -Remove Docs Folder '('currently contain only unit-tests coverage report')'
	@echo	  6. call: make clean  \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ -Remove build Folder '('Carefully')'
