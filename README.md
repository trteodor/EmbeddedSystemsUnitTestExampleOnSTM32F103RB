Hello, in this repository I learned how to use the Unity and Cmock framework, and the makefile syntax.
* http://www.throwtheswitch.org/unity

I got acquainted with the syntax of makefiles and thanks to that **_I built my own build system_**
* In my opinion, the created building system is very easy and convenient

This example usage CubeMX to generate project template for STM32F103
* Of course, it is not necessary to use STM32CubeMX **_the build system for unit tests is independent._** STM32CubeMX only create template for microcontroller Project.
* I am thinking of other microcontrollers like atmega, NXP, Renesas, MicroChip dk else ;) 

**_Created build system using non recursive makefile_**
* Evry one tested file may be compilated totally independent! :) 
* It may be benefits

To download this repository tap in your command line:
* git clone --recursive https://github.com/trteodor/UnitTest_InEmbedded_Ex_OnSTM32F103RB

To compile this project i used:
* GNU Make 3.81
* ruby 2.7.4p191
* gcovr 5.0
* gcc 6.3.0

* These programs obviously had to be in the ("PATH") path of environment variables
* It means that it was possible to use this programs directly from the console


Call "make" in the project localisation to show this information:

-	@echo     Call: make help \ \ \ -show this information
-	@echo	  How Use it:
-	@echo	  1. call: make all  \ \ \ -To compile output files for Microcontroller
-	@echo	  Its default target generated by CubeMX so was Decided to dont modify it
-	@echo	  ------------------------------------
-	@echo	  2. Call: make test-ra \ \ \ \ \ \ -To start compilation or fully recompilation all unit-test
-	@echo	  3. Call: make test-s \ \ \  \ \ \ -Only to rebuild source files and start unit tests
-	@echo	  4. Call: make coverage \ \ \ \ \ -To refresh coverage report
-	@echo	  ------------------------------------
-	@echo	  5. call: make clean-test \ \ \ -To delete all test result
-	@echo	  6. call: make clean-docs  \ \ \ -Remove Docs Folder '('currently contain only unit-tests coverage report')'
-	@echo	  6. call: make clean  \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ -Remove build Folder '('Carefully')'
